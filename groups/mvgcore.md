The microbiome and virome core facility of the [Department of Medicine](https://www.uni-due.de/med/) is operated by the [Institute for AI in medicine(IKIM)](./groups/ds).

The facility is co-led by Dr. Ivana Kraiselburd and Prof. Dr. Folker Meyer.

The facility provides high throughput genoyping capabilities using a number of laboratory and computational techniques including robotics and long and short read DNA sequencing technologies.

Examples are:

- genomic shotgun sequencing  of Bacteria and Viruses
- amplicon sequencing of viral and bacterial genomes 
- amplicon based characterization of microbiomes
- (meta-) genomic sequencing combining both long (3rd gen) and short read technologies (NGS)

The core works with various departments throughout the University Medicine Essen and the University of Duisburg-Essen and provides expertise in experimental design, sample preparation, sample handling, data storage and data analysis. The core provides a number of automated, reprocible analysis pipelines using SnakeMake.
