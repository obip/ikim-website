Research Training Group "WisPerMed" - Knowledge- and Data-Based Personalization of Medicine at the Point of Care

At the center of the research training group WisPerMed, which is funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) with a total of 5 million euros, is the goal of a knowledge- and data-based personalization of the therapy of malignant melanoma. In the first cohort, twelve different projects are being worked on by 7 female doctoral students and 5 male doctoral students.


A special feature of the research group are interdisciplinary working groups, which consist of 3-4 PhD students from different disciplines. Their goal is to exchange ideas among themselves and to develop a research project that will be published in a peer-reviewed journal.

 
The researchers do not rely solely on artificial intelligence (AI) in their scientific work, but also deliberately integrate user experience and behavior. During the three-year curriculum, the participating young scientists can pursue a doctorate in computer science, psychology or medical informatics.
