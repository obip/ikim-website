  abstract  = "Background The growth of biomedical literature presents
               challenges in extracting and structuring knowledge. Knowledge
               Graphs (KGs) offer a solution by representing relationships
               between biomedical entities. However, manual construction of KGs
               is labor-intensive and time-consuming, highlighting the need for
               automated methods. This work introduces BioKGrapher, a tool for
               automatic KG construction using large-scale publication data,
               with a focus on biomedical concepts related to specific medical
               conditions. BioKGrapher allows researchers to construct KGs from
               PubMed IDs. Methods The BioKGrapher pipeline begins with Named
               Entity Recognition and Linking (NER+NEL) to extract and
               normalize biomedical concepts from PubMed, mapping them to the
               Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). Extracted concepts are
               weighted and re-ranked using Kullback-Leibler divergence and
               local frequency balancing. These concepts are then integrated
               into hierarchical KGs, with relationships formed using
               terminologies like SNOMED CT and NCIt. Downstream applications
               include multi-label document classification using
               Adapter-infused Transformer models. Results BioKGrapher
               effectively aligns generated concepts with clinical practice
               guidelines from the German Guideline Program in Oncology (GGPO),
               achieving F 1 -Scores of up to 0.6. In multi-label
               classification, Adapter-infused models using a BioKGrapher
               cancer-specific KG improved micro F 1 -Scores by up to 0.89
               percentage points over a non-specific KG and 2.16 points over
               base models across three BERT variants. The drug-disease
               extraction case study identified indications for Nivolumab and
               Rituximab. Conclusion BioKGrapher is a tool for automatic KG
               construction, aligning with the GGPO and enhancing downstream
               task performance. It offers a scalable solution for managing

               intelligence (AI) and digital pathology advancements have shown
               promise in predicting outcomes in cancer. We aimed to improve
               prognosis prediction for PHCC by combining AI-based
               histopathological slide analysis with clinical factors. Methods:
               We retrospectively analyzed 317 surgically treated PHCC patients
               (January 2009-December 2018) at the University Hospital of
               Essen. Clinical data, surgical details, pathology, and outcomes
               were collected. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) analyzed
               whole-slide images. Survival models incorporated clinical and
               histological features. Results: Among 142 eligible patients,
               independent survival predictors were tumor grade (G), tumor size
               (T), and intraoperative transfusion requirement. The CNN-based
               model combining clinical and histopathological features
               demonstrates proof of concept in prognosis prediction, limited
               by histopathological complexity and feature extraction
               challenges. However, the CNN-based model generated heatmaps
               assisting pathologists in identifying areas of interest.
               Conclusion: AI-based digital pathology showed potential in PHCC
               prognosis prediction, though refinement is necessary for
               clinical relevance. Future research should focus on enhancing AI

               has been proposed to enable health data interoperability. So
               far, its applicability has been demonstrated for selected
               research projects with limited data. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed
               to design and implement a conceptual medical intelligence
               framework to leverage real-world care data for clinical
               decision-making. METHODS: A Python package for the use of
               multimodal FHIR data (FHIRPACK [FHIR Python Analysis Conversion
               Kit]) was developed and pioneered in 5 real-world clinical use
               cases, that is, myocardial infarction, stroke, diabetes, sepsis,
               and prostate cancer. Patients were identified based on the
               ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth
               Revision) codes, and outcomes were derived from laboratory
               tests, prescriptions, procedures, and diagnostic reports.
               Results were provided as browser-based dashboards. RESULTS: For
               2022, a total of 1,302,988 patient encounters were analyzed. (1)
               Myocardial infarction: in 72.7\% (261/359) of cases, medication
               regimens fulfilled guideline recommendations. (2) Stroke: out of
               1277 patients, 165 received thrombolysis and 108 thrombectomy.
               (3) Diabetes: in 443,866 serum glucose and 16,180 glycated
               hemoglobin A1c measurements from 35,494 unique patients, the
               prevalence of dysglycemic findings was 39\% (13,887/35,494).
               Among those with dysglycemia, diagnosis was coded in 44.2\%
               (6138/13,887) of the patients. (4) Sepsis: In 1803 patients,
               Staphylococcus epidermidis was the primarily isolated pathogen
               (773/2672, 28.9\%) and piperacillin and tazobactam was the
               primarily prescribed antibiotic (593/1593, 37.2\%). (5) PC: out
               of 54, three patients who received radical prostatectomy were
               identified as cases with prostate-specific antigen persistence
               or biochemical recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Leveraging FHIR data
               through large-scale analytics can enhance health care quality
               and improve patient outcomes across 5 clinical specialties. We
               identified (1) patients with sepsis requiring less broad
               antibiotic therapy, (2) patients with myocardial infarction who
               could benefit from statin and antiplatelet therapy, (3) patients
               who had a stroke with longer than recommended times to
               intervention, (4) patients with hyperglycemia who could benefit
               from specialist referral, and (5) patients with PC with early
               increases in cancer markers.",

               We investigated the influence of body composition and pulmonary
               fat attenuation volume (CTpfav) on overall survival (OS) in NSIP
               patients. METHODS: In this retrospective single-center study, 71
               NSIP patients with a median age of 65 years (interquartile range
               21.5), 39 females (55\%), who had a computed tomography from
               August 2009 to February 2018, were included, of whom 38 (54\%)
               died during follow-up. Body composition analysis was performed
               using an open-source nnU-Net-based framework. Features were
               combined into: Sarcopenia (muscle/bone); Fat (total adipose
               tissue/bone); Myosteatosis (inter-/intra-muscular adipose
               tissue/total adipose tissue); Mediastinal (mediastinal adipose
               tissue/bone); and Pulmonary fat index (CTpfav/lung volume).
               Kaplan-Meier analysis with a log-rank test and multivariate Cox
               regression were used for survival analyses. RESULTS: Patients
               with a higher (> median) Sarcopenia and lower (< median)
               Mediastinal Fat index had a significantly better survival
               probability (2-year survival rate: 83\% versus 71\% for high
               versus low Sarcopenia index, p = 0.023; 83\% versus 72\% for low
               versus high Mediastinal fat index, p = 0.006). In univariate
               analysis, individuals with a higher Pulmonary fat index
               exhibited significantly worse survival probability (2-year
               survival rate: 61\% versus 94\% for high versus low, p = 0.003).
               Additionally, it was an independent risk predictor for death
               (hazard ratio 2.37, 95\% confidence interval 1.03-5.48, p =
               0.043). CONCLUSION: Fully automated body composition analysis
               offers interesting perspectives in patients with NSIP. Pulmonary
               fat index was an independent predictor of OS. RELEVANCE
               STATEMENT: The Pulmonary fat index is an independent predictor
               of OS in patients with NSIP and demonstrates the potential of
               fully automated, deep-learning-driven body composition analysis

              comorbidity in adult people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF),
              resulting in an increased risk of bone fractures. This study
              evaluated the capacity of artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted
              low-dose chest CT (LDCT) opportunistic screening for detecting
              low bone mineral density (BMD) in adult pwCF. Methods: In this
              retrospective single-center study, 65 adult pwCF (mean age 30.1
              $\pm$ 7.5 years) underwent dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)
              of the lumbar vertebrae L1 to L4 to determine BMD and
              corresponding z-scores and completed LDCTs of the chest within
              three months as part of routine clinical care. A fully automated
              CT-based AI algorithm measured the attenuation values (Hounsfield
              units [HU]) of the thoracic vertebrae Th9-Th12 and first lumbar
              vertebra L1. The ability of the algorithm to diagnose CFBD was
              assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.
              Results: HU values of Th9 to L1 and DXA-derived BMD and the
              corresponding z-scores of L1 to L4 showed a strong correlation
              (all p < 0.05). The area under the curve (AUC) for diagnosing low
              BMD was highest for L1 (0.796; p = 0.001) and Th11 (0.835; p <
              0.001), resulting in a specificity of 84.9\% at a sensitivity
              level of 75\%. The HU threshold values for distinguishing normal
              from low BMD were <197 (L1) and <212 (Th11), respectively.
              Conclusions: Routine LDCT of the chest with the fully automated
              AI-guided determination of thoracic and lumbar vertebral
              attenuation values is a valuable tool for predicting low BMD in
              adult pwCF, with the best results for Th11 and L1. However,

              extracted from fully automated body composition analysis (BCA) of
              computed tomography (CT) angiography images of endovascularly
              treated acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients regarding
              angiographic and clinical outcome. METHODS: Retrospective
              analysis of AIS patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy
              (MT) at three tertiary care-centers between March 2019-January
              2022. Baseline demographics, angiographic outcome and clinical
              outcome evaluated by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at discharge
              were noted. Multiple tissues, such as muscle, bone, and adipose
              tissue were acquired with a deep-learning-based, fully automated
              BCA from CT images of the supra-aortic angiography. RESULTS: A
              total of 290 stroke patients who underwent MT due to cerebral
              vessel occlusion in the anterior circulation were included in the
              study. In the univariate analyses, among all BCA markers, only
              the lower sarcopenia marker was associated with a poor outcome
              (P=0.007). It remained an independent predictor for an
              unfavorable outcome in a logistic regression analysis (OR 0.6,
              95\% CI 0.3 to 0.9, P=0.044). Fat index (total adipose
              tissue/bone) and myosteatosis index (inter- and intramuscular
              adipose tissue/total adipose tissue*100) did not affect clinical
              outcomes. CONCLUSION: Acute ischemic stroke patients with a lower
              sarcopenia marker are at risk for an unfavorable outcome. Imaging
              biomarkers extracted from BCA can be easily obtained from
              existing CT images, making it readily available at the beginning
              of treatment. However, further research is necessary to determine
              whether sarcopenia provides additional value beyond established
              outcome predictors. Understanding its role could lead to
              optimized, individualized treatment plans for post-stroke
              patients, potentially improving recovery outcomes.",

               for clinicians and for artificial intelligence orchestration to
               select the most appropriate series for analysis. However, this
               information is commonly extracted from the CT metadata, which is
               often wrong. This study aimed at developing an automatic
               pipeline for classifying intravenous (IV) contrast phases and
               additionally for identifying contrast media in the
               gastrointestinal tract (GIT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This
               retrospective study used 1200 CT scans collected at the
               investigating institution between January 4, 2016 and September
               12, 2022, and 240 CT scans from multiple centers from The Cancer
               Imaging Archive for external validation. The open-source
               segmentation algorithm TotalSegmentator was used to identify
               regions of interest (pulmonary artery, aorta, stomach,
               portal/splenic vein, liver, portal vein/hepatic veins, inferior
               vena cava, duodenum, small bowel, colon, left/right kidney,
               urinary bladder), and machine learning classifiers were trained
               with 5-fold cross-validation to classify IV contrast phases
               (noncontrast, pulmonary arterial, arterial, venous, and
               urographic) and GIT contrast enhancement. The performance of the
               ensembles was evaluated using the receiver operating
               characteristic area under the curve (AUC) and 95\% confidence
               intervals (CIs). RESULTS: For the IV phase classification task,
               the following AUC scores were obtained for the internal test
               set: 99.59\% [95\% CI, 99.58-99.63] for the noncontrast phase,
               99.50\% [95\% CI, 99.49-99.52] for the pulmonary-arterial phase,
               99.13\% [95\% CI, 99.10-99.15] for the arterial phase, 99.8\%
               [95\% CI, 99.79-99.81] for the venous phase, and 99.7\% [95\%
               CI, 99.68-99.7] for the urographic phase. For the external
               dataset, a mean AUC of 97.33\% [95\% CI, 97.27-97.35] and
               97.38\% [95\% CI, 97.34-97.41] was achieved for all contrast
               phases for the first and second annotators, respectively.
               Contrast media in the GIT could be identified with an AUC of
               99.90\% [95\% CI, 99.89-99.9] in the internal dataset, whereas
               in the external dataset, an AUC of 99.73\% [95\% CI,
               99.71-99.73] and 99.31\% [95\% CI, 99.27-99.33] was achieved

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Medical text, as part of an electronic health
               record, is an essential information source in healthcare.
               Although natural language processing (NLP) techniques for
               medical text are developing fast, successful transfer into
               clinical practice has been rare. Especially the hospital domain
               offers great potential while facing several challenges including
               many documents per patient, multiple departments and complex
               interrelated processes. METHODS: In this work, we survey
               relevant literature to identify and classify approaches which
               exploit NLP in the clinical context. Our contribution involves a
               systematic mapping of related research onto a prototypical
               patient journey in the hospital, along which medical documents
               are created, processed and consumed by hospital staff and
               patients themselves. Specifically, we reviewed which dataset
               types, dataset languages, model architectures and tasks are
               researched in current clinical NLP research. Additionally, we
               extract and analyze major obstacles during development and
               implementation. We discuss options to address them and argue for
               a focus on bias mitigation and model explainability. RESULTS:
               While a patient's hospital journey produces a significant amount
               of structured and unstructured documents, certain steps and
               documents receive more research attention than others.
               Diagnosis, Admission and Discharge are clinical patient steps
               that are researched often across the surveyed paper. In
               contrast, our findings reveal significant under-researched areas
               such as Treatment, Billing, After Care, and Smart Home.
               Leveraging NLP in these stages can greatly enhance clinical
               decision-making and patient outcomes. Additionally, clinical NLP
               models are mostly based on radiology reports, discharge letters
               and admission notes, even though we have shown that many other
               documents are produced throughout the patient journey. There is
               a significant opportunity in analyzing a wider range of medical
               documents produced throughout the patient journey to improve the
               applicability and impact of NLP in healthcare. CONCLUSIONS: Our
               findings suggest that there is a significant opportunity to
               leverage NLP approaches to advance clinical decision-making
               systems, as there remains a considerable understudied potential
               for the analysis of patient journey data.",

               have recently been identified as relevant prognostic factors for
               patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Herein, we aimed
               to investigate the role of BCA parameters for prognosis
               prediction in patients with HCC undergoing transarterial
               chemoembolization (TACE). Methods: This retrospective
               multicenter study included a total of 754 treatment-na{\"\i}ve
               patients with HCC who underwent TACE at six tertiary care
               centers between 2010-2020. Fully automated artificial
               intelligence-based quantitative 3D volumetry of abdominal cavity
               tissue composition was performed to assess skeletal muscle
               volume (SM), total adipose tissue (TAT), intra- and
               intermuscular adipose tissue, visceral adipose tissue, and
               subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) on pre-intervention computed
               tomography scans. BCA parameters were normalized to the slice
               number of the abdominal cavity. We assessed the influence of BCA
               parameters on median overall survival and performed multivariate
               analysis including established estimates of survival. Results:
               Univariate survival analysis revealed that impaired median
               overall survival was predicted by low SM (p <0.001), high TAT
               volume (p = 0.013), and high SAT volume (p = 0.006). In
               multivariate survival analysis, SM remained an independent
               prognostic factor (p = 0.039), while TAT and SAT volumes no
               longer showed predictive ability. This predictive role of SM was
               confirmed in a subgroup analysis of patients with BCLC stage B.
               Conclusions: SM is an independent prognostic factor for survival
               prediction. Thus, the integration of SM into novel scoring
               systems could potentially improve survival prediction and
               clinical decision-making. Fully automated approaches are needed
               to foster the implementation of this imaging biomarker into
               daily routine. Impact and implications: Body composition
               assessment parameters, especially skeletal muscle volume, have
               been identified as relevant prognostic factors for many diseases
               and treatments. In this study, skeletal muscle volume has been
               identified as an independent prognostic factor for patients with
               hepatocellular carcinoma undergoing transarterial
               chemoembolization. Therefore, skeletal muscle volume as a
               metaparameter could play a role as an opportunistic biomarker in
               holistic patient assessment and be integrated into decision
               support systems. Workflow integration with artificial
               intelligence is essential for automated, quantitative body
               composition assessment, enabling broad availability in
               multidisciplinary case discussions.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Impaired microcirculation is a cornerstone of sepsis
               development and leads to reduced tissue oxygenation, influenced
               by fluid and catecholamine administration during treatment.
               Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a non-invasive bedside technology
               for visualizing physicochemical tissue characteristics. Machine
               learning (ML) for skin HSI might offer an automated approach for
               bedside microcirculation assessment, providing an individualized
               tissue fingerprint of critically ill patients in intensive care.
               The study aimed to determine if machine learning could be
               utilized to automatically identify regions of interest (ROIs) in
               the hand, thereby distinguishing between healthy individuals and
               critically ill patients with sepsis using HSI. METHODS: HSI raw
               data from 75 critically ill sepsis patients and from 30 healthy
               controls were recorded using TIVITA\textregistered{} Tissue
               System and analyzed using an automated ML approach.
               Additionally, patients were divided into two groups based on
               their SOFA scores for further subanalysis: less severely ill
               (SOFA $\leq$ 5) and severely ill (SOFA > 5). The analysis of the
               HSI raw data was fully-automated using MediaPipe for ROI
               detection (palm and fingertips) and feature extraction. HSI
               Features were statistically analyzed to highlight relevant
               wavelength combinations using Mann-Whitney-U test and Benjamini,
               Krieger, and Yekutieli (BKY) correction. In addition, Random
               Forest models were trained using bootstrapping, and feature
               importances were determined to gain insights regarding the
               wavelength importance for a model decision. RESULTS: An
               automated pipeline for generating ROIs and HSI feature
               extraction was successfully established. HSI raw data analysis
               accurately distinguished healthy controls from sepsis patients.
               Wavelengths at the fingertips differed in the ranges of 575-695
               nm and 840-1000 nm. For the palm, significant differences were
               observed in the range of 925-1000 nm. Feature importance plots
               indicated relevant information in the same wavelength ranges.
               Combining palm and fingertip analysis provided the highest
               reliability, with an AUC of 0.92 to distinguish between sepsis
               patients and healthy controls. CONCLUSION: Based on this proof
               of concept, the integration of automated and standardized ROIs
               along with automated skin HSI analyzes, was able to
               differentiate between healthy individuals and patients with
               sepsis. This approach offers a reliable and objective assessment
               of skin microcirculation, facilitating the rapid identification

               tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has established the precision
               oncology paradigm in lung cancer. Most patients with
               EGFR-mutated lung cancer respond but eventually acquire
               resistance. Methods: Patients exhibiting the EGFR p.T790M
               resistance biomarker benefit from sequenced targeted therapy
               with osimertinib. We hypothesized that metabolic response as
               detected by 18F-FDG PET after short-course osimertinib
               identifies additional patients susceptible to sequenced therapy.
               Results: Fourteen patients with EGFR-mutated lung cancer and
               resistance to first- or second-generation EGFR TKI testing
               negatively for EGFR p.T790M were enrolled in a phase II study.
               Five patients (36\%) achieved a metabolic 18F-FDG PET response
               and continued osimertinib. In those, the median duration of
               treatment was not reached (95\% CI, 24 mo to not estimable),
               median progression-free survival was 18.7 mo (95\% CI, 14.6 mo
               to not estimable), and median overall survival was 41.5 mo.
               Conclusion: Connecting theranostic osimertinib treatment with
               early metabolic response assessment by PET enables early
               identification of patients with unknown mechanisms of TKI
               resistance who derive dramatic clinical benefit from sequenced
               osimertinib. This defines a novel paradigm for personalization

               organ analysis (BOA), a comprehensive computed tomography (CT)
               image segmentation algorithm with a focus on workflow
               integration. Methods The BOA combines 2 segmentation algorithms:
               body composition analysis (BCA) and TotalSegmentator. The BCA
               was trained with the nnU-Net framework using a dataset including
               300 CT examinations. The CTs were manually annotated with 11
               semantic body regions: subcutaneous tissue, muscle, bone,
               abdominal cavity, thoracic cavity, glands, mediastinum,
               pericardium, breast implant, brain, and spinal cord. The models
               were trained using 5-fold cross-validation, and at inference
               time, an ensemble was used. Afterward, the segmentation
               efficiency was evaluated on a separate test set comprising 60 CT
               scans. In a postprocessing step, a tissue segmentation (muscle,
               subcutaneous adipose tissue, visceral adipose tissue,
               intermuscular adipose tissue, epicardial adipose tissue, and
               paracardial adipose tissue) is created by subclassifying the
               body regions. The BOA combines this algorithm and the
               open-source segmentation software TotalSegmentator to have an
               all-in-one comprehensive selection of segmentations. In
               addition, it integrates into clinical workflows as a DICOM
               node--triggered service using the open-source Orthanc research
               PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication System) server to make
               the automated segmentation algorithms available to clinicians.
               The BCA model's performance was evaluated using the
               S{\o}rensen-Dice score. Finally, the segmentations from the 3
               different tools (BCA, TotalSegmentator, and BOA) were compared
               by assessing the overall percentage of the segmented human body
               on a separate cohort of 150 whole-body CT scans. Results The
               results showed that the BCA outperformed the previous
               publication, achieving a higher S{\o}rensen-Dice score for the
               previously existing classes, including subcutaneous tissue
               (0.971 vs 0.962), muscle (0.959 vs 0.933), abdominal cavity
               (0.983 vs 0.973), thoracic cavity (0.982 vs 0.965), bone (0.961
               vs 0.942), and an overall good segmentation efficiency for newly
               introduced classes: brain (0.985), breast implant (0.943),
               glands (0.766), mediastinum (0.880), pericardium (0.964), and
               spinal cord (0.896). All in all, it achieved a 0.935 average
               S{\o}rensen-Dice score, which is comparable to the one of the
               TotalSegmentator (0.94). The TotalSegmentator had a mean voxel
               body coverage of 31\% $\pm$ 6\%, whereas BCA had a coverage of
               75\% $\pm$ 6\% and BOA achieved 93\% $\pm$ 2\%. Conclusions The
               open-source BOA merges different segmentation algorithms with a
               focus on workflow integration through DICOM node integration,

              composition analysis (BCA) was performed in patients with
              end-stage emphysema receiving BLVR with valves.
              Post-interventional muscle and adipose tissues were quantified,
              body size-adjusted, and compared to baseline parameters. Between
              January 2015 and December 2022, 300 patients with severe

               treatment. This study focuses on developing an automated
               MRI-based workflow to distinguish between PCNSL and gliomas.
               Methods MRI examinations of 240 therapy-naive patients (141
               males and 99 females, mean age: 55.16 years) with cerebral
               gliomas and PCNSLs (216 gliomas and 24 PCNSLs), each comprising
               a non-contrast T1-weighted, Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery
               (FLAIR), and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted sequence were
               included in the study. HD-GLIO, a pre-trained segmentation
               network, was used to generate segmentations automatically. To
               validate the segmentation efficiency, 237 manual segmentations
               were prepared (213 gliomas and 24 PCNSLs). Subsequently,
               radiomics features were extracted following feature and training
               of an XGBoost algorithm for classification. Results The
               segmentation models for gliomas and PCNSLs achieved a mean
               S{\o}rensen--Dice coefficient of 0.82 and 0.80 for whole tumors,
               respectively. Three classification models were developed in this
               study to differentiate gliomas from PCNSLs. The first model
               differentiated PCNSLs from gliomas, with an area under the curve
               (AUC) of 0.99 (F1-score: 0.75). The second model discriminated
               between high-grade gliomas and PCNSLs with an AUC of 0.91

               performance achieved a sensitivity of 93\% with a specificity of
               77\%. AI support for fracture detection significantly reduced
               interpretation time for radiology residents by an average of
               approximately 2.6 s (p = 0.0156) and increased resident
               confidence in the findings (p = 0.0013). Conclusion: AI support
               significantly enhanced fracture detection sensitivity among
               radiology residents, particularly benefiting less experienced
               radiologists. It does not compromise specificity and reduces
               interpretation time, contributing to improved efficiency. This

               role in training and interpretation improvement.",

               radiomics analysis and machine learning algorithms based on
               primary cervical cancers to predict N- and M-stage in patients.
               MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 30 patients with
               histopathological confirmation of primary and untreated cervical
               cancer were prospectively enrolled for a multiparametric 18F-FDG
               PET/MR examination, comprising a dedicated protocol for imaging
               of the female pelvis. The primary tumor in the uterine cervix
               was manually segmented on post-contrast T1-weighted images.
               Quantitative features were extracted from the segmented tumors
               using the Radiomic Image Processing Toolbox for the R software
               environment for statistical computing and graphics. 45 different
               image features were calculated from non-enhanced as well as
               post-contrast T1-weighted TSE images, T2-weighted TSE images,
               the ADC map, the parametric Ktrans, Kep, Ve and iAUC maps and
               PET images, respectively. Statistical analysis and modeling was
               performed using Python 3.5 and the scikit-learn software machine
               learning library for the Python programming language. RESULTS:
               Prediction of M-stage was superior when compared to N-stage.
               Prediction of M-stage using SVM with SVM-RFE as feature
               selection obtained the highest performance providing sensitivity
               of 91 \% and specificity of 92 \%. Using receiver operating
               characteristic (ROC) analysis of the pooled predictions, the
               area under the curve (AUC) was 0.97. Prediction of N-stage using
               RBF-SVM with MIFS as feature selection reached sensitivity of 83
               \%, specificity of 67 \% and an AUC of 0.82. CONCLUSION: M- and
               N-stage can be predicted based on isolated radiomics analyses of
               the primary tumor in cervical cancers, thus serving as a

              AI into clinical practice is still challenging and
              under-appreciated. We aim to demonstrate a possible vertical
              integration approach to close the loop for AI-ready radiology.
              METHOD: This study highlights the importance of two-way
              communication for AI-assisted radiology. As a key part of the
              methodology, it demonstrates the integration of AI systems into
              clinical practice with structured reports and AI visualization,
              giving more insight into the AI system. By integrating
              cooperative lifelong learning into the AI system, we ensure the
              long-term effectiveness of the AI system, while keeping the
              radiologist in the loop. RESULTS: We demonstrate the use of
              lifelong learning for AI systems by incorporating AI
              visualization and structured reports. We evaluate Memory

               that works directly in the information rich complex valued
               k-space. METHODS: Using four datasets from different
               institutions with a total of around 200,000 MRI slices, we show
               that our network can perform skull-stripping on the raw data of
               MRIs while preserving the phase information which no other skull
               stripping algorithm is able to work with. For two of the
               datasets, skull stripping performed by HD-BET (Brain Extraction
               Tool) in the image domain is used as the ground truth, whereas
               the third and fourth dataset comes with per-hand annotated brain
               segmentations. RESULTS: All four datasets were very similar to
               the ground truth (DICE scores of 92 \%-99 \% and Hausdorff
               distances of under 5.5 pixel). Results on slices above the
               eye-region reach DICE scores of up to 99 \%, whereas the
               accuracy drops in regions around the eyes and below, with
               partially blurred output. The output of k-Strip often has
               smoothed edges at the demarcation to the skull. Binary masks are

               information, with consistent results. Besides preserving
               valuable information for further diagnostics, this approach
               makes an immediate anonymization of patient data possible,

               resource-consuming task for physicians and transfusion managers
               of large hospitals. Inpatient numbers and institutional
               standards play significant roles in PDM. However, reliance on
               these factors alone commonly results in platelet shortages.
               Using data from multiple sources, we developed, validated,
               tested, and implemented a patient-specific approach to support
               PDM that uses a deep learning-based risk score to forecast
               platelet transfusions for each hospitalized patient in the next
               24 hours. The models were developed using retrospective
               electronic health record data of 34 809 patients treated between
               2017 and 2022. Static and time-dependent features included
               demographics, diagnoses, procedures, blood counts, past
               transfusions, hematotoxic medications, and hospitalization
               duration. Using an expanding window approach, we created a
               training and live-prediction pipeline with a 30-day input and
               24-hour forecast. Hyperparameter tuning determined the best
               validation area under the precision-recall curve (AUC-PR) score
               for long short-term memory deep learning models, which were then
               tested on independent data sets from the same hospital. The
               model tailored for hematology and oncology patients exhibited
               the best performance (AUC-PR, 0.84; area under the receiver
               operating characteristic curve [ROC-AUC], 0.98), followed by a
               multispecialty model covering all other patients (AUC-PR, 0.73).
               The model specific to cardiothoracic surgery had the lowest
               performance (AUC-PR, 0.42), likely because of unexpected
               intrasurgery bleedings. To our knowledge, this is the first deep
               learning-based platelet transfusion predictor enabling
               individualized 24-hour risk assessments at high AUC-PR.
               Implemented as a decision-support system, deep-learning

              benefits of these algorithms for medical AI, in particular for
              radiology, there is no empirical evidence for improved accuracy
              in histopathology. Therefore, based on the ConvNeXt architecture,
              our study performs a systematic comparison of nine task
              adaptation techniques, namely, DELTA, L2-SP, MARS-PGM, Bi-Tuning,
              BSS, MultiTune, SpotTune, Co-Tuning, and vanilla fine-tuning, on
              five histopathological classification tasks using eight datasets.
              The results are based on external testing and statistical
              validation and reveal a multifaceted picture: some techniques are
              better suited for histopathology than others, but depending on
              the classification task, a significant relative improvement in
              accuracy was observed for five advanced task adaptation
              techniques over the control method, i.e., vanilla fine-tuning
              (e.g., Co-Tuning: P(≫) = 0.942, d = 2.623). Furthermore, we
              studied the classification accuracy for three of the nine methods
              with respect to the training set size (e.g., Co-Tuning: P(≫) =
              0.951, $\gamma$ = 0.748). Overall, our results show that the
              performance of advanced task adaptation techniques in
              histopathology is affected by influencing factors such as the
              specific classification task or the size of the training dataset.",

               state-of-the-art. In addition to distress scores, individual
               care needs are an important factor for the initiation of
               psycho-oncological interventions. In a mono-centric,
               observational study, we aimed for characterization of patients
               indicating a subjective need but declining to utilize support
               services immediately to facilitate implementation of adapted
               screenings. METHODS: This study analyzed retrospective data from
               routine distress screening and associated data from hospital
               records. Descriptive, variance and regression analyses were used
               to assess characteristics of postponed support utilization in
               patients with mixed cancer diagnoses in different treatment
               settings. RESULTS: Of the total sample (N = 1863), 13\%
               indicated a subjective need but postponed support utilization.
               This subgroup presented as being as burdened by symptoms of
               depression (p < 0.001), anxiety (p < 0.001) and distress (p <
               0.001) as subjectively distressed patients with intent to
               directly utilize support. Time periods since diagnosis were
               shorter (p = 0.007) and patients were more often inpatients (p =
               0.045). CONCLUSIONS: Despite high heterogeneity among the
               subgroups, this study identified distress-related factors and
               time since diagnosis as possible predictors for postponed
               utilization of psycho-oncological interventions. Results suggest
               the necessity for time-individualized support which may improve

  abstract = "OBJECTIVES: Liver volumetry based on a computed tomography scan
              is widely used to estimate liver volume before any liver
              resection, especially before living donorliver donation. The
              1-to-1 conversion rule for liver volume to liver weight has been
              widely adopted; however, debate continues regarding this
              approach. Therefore, we analyzed the relationship between the
              left-lateral lobe liver graft volume and actual graft weight.
              MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study retrospectively included
              consecutive donors who underwent left lateral hepatectomy for
              pediatric living donor liver transplant from December 2008 to
              September 2020. All donors were healthy adults who met the
              evaluation criteria for pediatric living donor liver transplant
              and underwent a preoperative contrast-enhanced computed
              tomography scan. Manual segmentation of the leftlateral liverlobe
              for graft volume estimation and intraoperative measurement of an
              actual graft weight were performed. The relationship between
              estimated graft volume and actual graft weight was analyzed.
              RESULTS: Ninety-four living liver donors were included in the
              study. The mean actual graft weight was ~283.4 $\pm$ 68.5 g, and
              the mean graft volume was 244.9 $\pm$ 63.86 mL. A strong
              correlation was shown between graft volume and actual graft
              weight (r = 0.804; P < .001). Bland-Altman analysis revealed an
              interobserver agreement of 38.0 $\pm$ 97.25, and intraclass
              correlation coefficient showed almost perfect agreement(r =
              0.840; P < .001). The conversion formula for calculating graft
              weight based on computed tomography volumetry was determined
              based on regression analysis: 0.88 $\times$ graft volume + 41.63.
              CONCLUSIONS: The estimation of left liver graft weight using only
              the 1-to-1 rule is subject to measurable variability in
              calculated graft weights and tends to underestimate the true
              graft weight. Instead, a different, improved conversion formula
              should be used to calculate graft weight to more accurately
              determine donor graft weight-to-recipient body weightratio and
              reduce the risk of underestimation of liver graft weightin the
              donor selection process before pediatric living donor liver

               computational dermatopathology, evidenced by a significant
               increase in this topic in the current literature. We aim to
               provide a structured and comprehensive overview of peer-reviewed
               publications on DL applied to dermatopathology focused on
               melanoma. In comparison to well-published DL methods on
               non-medical images (e.g., classification on ImageNet), this
               field of application comprises a specific set of challenges,
               such as staining artifacts, large gigapixel images, and various
               magnification levels. Thus, we are particularly interested in
               the pathology-specific technical state-of-the-art. We also aim
               to summarize the best performances achieved thus far with
               respect to accuracy, along with an overview of self-reported
               limitations. Accordingly, we conducted a systematic literature
               review of peer-reviewed journal and conference articles
               published between 2012 and 2022 in the databases ACM Digital
               Library, Embase, IEEE Xplore, PubMed, and Scopus, expanded by
               forward and backward searches to identify 495 potentially
               eligible studies. After screening for relevance and quality, a
               total of 54 studies were included. We qualitatively summarized
               and analyzed these studies from technical, problem-oriented, and
               task-oriented perspectives. Our findings suggest that the
               technical aspects of DL for histopathology in melanoma can be
               further improved. The DL methodology was adopted later in this
               field, and still lacks the wider adoption of DL methods already
               shown to be effective for other applications. We also discuss
               upcoming trends toward ImageNet-based feature extraction and
               larger models. While DL has achieved human-competitive accuracy
               in routine pathological tasks, its performance on advanced tasks
               is still inferior to wet-lab testing (for example). Finally, we
               discuss the challenges impeding the translation of DL methods to
               clinical practice and provide insight into future research

               sarcopenia in respective muscles of large cohorts. As such, the
               approach comprises the texture feature extraction from raw data
               based on well established approaches, such as a nnU-Net neural
               network and the Pyradiomics toolbox, a subsequent selection
               according to adequate conditions for the muscle tissue of the
               general population, and an importance-based ranking to further
               narrow the amount of meaningful features with respect to
               auxiliary targets. The performance was investigated with respect
               to the included auxiliary targets, namely age, body mass index
               (BMI), and fat fraction (FF). Four skeletal muscles with
               different fiber architecture were included: the mm. glutaei, m.

               selection allowed for a reduction from 1015 available texture
               features to 65 for age, 53 for BMI, and 36 for FF from the
               available fat/water contrast images considering all muscles

  abstract  = "Introduction: An increasing shortage of donor blood is expected,
               considering the demographic change in Germany. Due to the short
               shelf life and varying daily fluctuations in consumption, the
               storage of platelet concentrates (PCs) becomes challenging. This
               emphasizes the need for reliable prediction of needed PCs for
               the blood bank inventories. Therefore, the objective of this
               study was to evaluate multimodal data from multiple source
               systems within a hospital to predict the number of platelet
               transfusions in 3 days on a per-patient level. Methods: Data
               were collected from 25,190 (42\% female and 58\% male) patients
               between 2017 and 2021. For each patient, the number of received
               PCs, platelet count blood tests, drugs causing thrombocytopenia,
               acute platelet diseases, procedures, age, gender, and the period
               of a patient's hospital stay were collected. Two models were
               trained on samples using a sliding window of 7 days as input and
               a day 3 target. The model predicts whether a patient will be
               transfused 3 days in the future. The model was trained with an
               excessive hyperparameter search using patient-level repeated
               5-fold cross-validation to optimize the average macro F2-score.
               Results: The trained models were tested on 5,022 unique
               patients. The best-performing model has a specificity of 0.99, a
               sensitivity of 0.37, an area under the precision-recall curve
               score of 0.45, an MCC score of 0.43, and an F1-score of 0.43.
               However, the model does not generalize well for cases when the
               need for a platelet transfusion is recognized. Conclusion: A
               patient AI-based platelet forecast could improve logistics
               management and reduce blood product waste. In this study, we
               build the first model to predict patient individual platelet
               demand. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to
               introduce this approach. Our model predicts the need for
               platelet units for 3 days in the future. While sensitivity
               underperforms, specificity performs reliably. The model may be
               of clinical use as a pretest for potential patients needing a
               platelet transfusion within the next 3 days. As sensitivity
               needs to be improved, further studies should introduce deep
               learning and wider patient characterization to the
               methodological multimodal, multisource data approach.

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: We present FHIR-PYrate, a Python package to handle
              the full clinical data collection and extraction process. The
              software is to be plugged into a modern hospital domain, where
              electronic patient records are used to handle the entire
              patient's history. Most research institutes follow the same
              procedures to build study cohorts, but mainly in a
              non-standardized and repetitive way. As a result, researchers
              spend time writing boilerplate code, which could be used for more
              challenging tasks. METHODS: The package can improve and simplify
              existing processes in the clinical research environment. It
              collects all needed functionalities into a straightforward
              interface that can be used to query a FHIR server, download
              imaging studies and filter clinical documents. The full capacity
              of the search mechanism of the FHIR REST API is available to the
              user, leading to a uniform querying process for all resources,
              thus simplifying the customization of each use case.
              Additionally, valuable features like parallelization and
              filtering are included to make it more performant. RESULTS: As an
              exemplary practical application, the package can be used to
              analyze the prognostic significance of routine CT imaging and
              clinical data in breast cancer with tumor metastases in the
              lungs. In this example, the initial patient cohort is first
              collected using ICD-10 codes. For these patients, the survival
              information is also gathered. Some additional clinical data is
              retrieved, and CT scans of the thorax are downloaded. Finally,
              the survival analysis can be computed using a deep learning model
              with the CT scans, the TNM staging and positivity of relevant
              markers as input. This process may vary depending on the FHIR
              server and available clinical data, and can be customized to
              cover even more use cases. CONCLUSIONS: FHIR-PYrate opens up the
              possibility to quickly and easily retrieve FHIR data, download
              image data, and search medical documents for keywords within a

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Body tissue composition plays a crucial role in the
              multisystemic processes of advanced liver disease and has been
              shown to be influenced by transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic
              shunt (TIPS). A differentiated analysis of the various tissue
              compartments has not been performed until now. The purpose of
              this study was to evaluate the value of imaging biomarkers
              derived from automated body composition analysis (BCA) to predict
              clinical and functional outcome. METHODS: A retrospective
              analysis of 56 patients undergoing TIPS procedure between 2013
              and 2021 was performed. BCA on the base of pre-interventional CT
              examination was used to determine quantitative data as well as
              ratios of bone, muscle and fat masses. Furthermore, a BCA-derived
              sarcopenia marker was investigated. Regarding potential
              correlations between BCA imaging biomarkers and the occurrence of
              hepatic encephalopathy (HE) as well as 1-year survival, an
              exploratory analysis was conducted. RESULTS: No BCA imaging
              biomarker was associated with the occurrence of HE after TIPS
              placement. However, there were significant differences in alive
              and deceased patients regarding the BCA-derived sarcopenia marker
              (alive: 1.60, deceased: 1.83, p = 0.046), ratios of intra- and
              intermuscular fat/skeletal volume (alive: 0.53, deceased: 0.31, p
              = 0.015) and intra- and intermuscular fat/muscle volume (alive:
              0.21, deceased: 0.14, p = 0.031). CONCLUSION: A lower amount of
              intra- and intermuscular adipose tissue might have protective
              effects regarding liver derived complications and survival.

               with generative adversarial networks (GANs) in a large animal
               model.MethodsWith 20 healthy G{\"o}ttingen minipigs, a total of
               120 magnetic resonance imaging examinations were performed on 6
               different occasions, 50\% with reduced (low-dose; 0.005 mmol/kg,
               gadoxetate) and 50\% standard dose (normal-dose; 0.025 mmol/kg).
               These included arterial, portal venous, venous, and
               hepatobiliary contrast phases (20 minutes, 30 minutes). Because
               of incomplete examinations, one animal had to be excluded.
               Randomly, 3 of 19 animals were selected and withheld for
               validation (18 examinations). Subsequently, a GAN was trained
               for image-to-image conversion from low-dose to normal-dose
               (virtual normal-dose) with the remaining 16 animals (96
               examinations). For validation, vascular and parenchymal
               contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) was calculated using region of
               interest measurements of the abdominal aorta, inferior vena
               cava, portal vein, hepatic parenchyma, and autochthonous back
               muscles. In parallel, a visual Turing test was performed by
               presenting the normal-dose and virtual normal-dose data to 3
               consultant radiologists, blinded for the type of examination.
               They had to decide whether they would consider both data sets as
               consistent in findings and which images were from the
               normal-dose study.ResultsThe pooled dynamic phase vascular and
               parenchymal CNR increased significantly from low-dose to virtual
               normal-dose (pooled vascular:PP= 0.0002) and was found to be not
               significantly different between virtual normal-dose and
               normal-dose examinations (vascular CNR [mean $\pm$ SD]: low-dose
               17.6 $\pm$ 6.0, virtual normal-dose 41.8 $\pm$ 9.7, and

               low-dose 20.2 $\pm$ 5.9, virtual normal-dose 28.3 $\pm$ 6.9, and
               normal-dose 29.5 $\pm$ 7.2). The pooled parenchymal CNR of the
               hepatobiliary contrast phases revealed a significant increase
               from the low-dose (22.8 $\pm$ 6.2) to the virtual normal-dose
               (33.2 $\pm$ 6.1;PPConclusionsIn this feasibility study in
               healthy G{\"o}ttingen minipigs, it could be shown that GAN-based

               (CM) dose or radiation dose in thoracoabdominal computed
               tomography angiography (CTA) by automated tube voltage selection
               (ATVS) system configuration and CM protocol adaption. METHODS:
               In six minipigs, CTA-optimized protocols were evaluated
               regarding objective (contrast-to-noise ratio, CNR) and
               subjective (6 criteria assessed by Likert scale) image quality.
               Scan parameters were automatically adapted by the ATVS system
               operating at 90-kV semi-mode and configured for standard, CM
               saving, or radiation dose saving (image task, quality settings).
               Injection protocols (dose, flow rate) were adapted manually.
               This approach was tested for normal and simulated obese
               conditions. RESULTS: Radiation exposure (volume-weighted CT dose
               index) for normal (obese) conditions was 2.4 $\pm$ 0.7 (5.0
               $\pm$ 0.7) mGy (standard), 4.3 $\pm$ 1.1 (9.0 $\pm$ 1.3) mGy (CM
               reduced), and 1.7 $\pm$ 0.5 (3.5 $\pm$ 0.5) mGy (radiation
               reduced). The respective CM doses for normal (obese) settings
               were 210 (240) mgI/kg, 155 (177) mgI/kg, and 252 (288) mgI/kg.
               No significant differences in CNR (normal; obese) were observed
               between standard (17.8 $\pm$ 3.0; 19.2 $\pm$ 4.0), CM-reduced
               (18.2 $\pm$ 3.3; 20.5 $\pm$ 4.9), and radiation-saving CTAs
               (16.0 $\pm$ 3.4; 18.4 $\pm$ 4.1). Subjective analysis showed
               similar values for optimized and standard CTAs. Only the
               parameter diagnostic acceptability was significantly lower for
               radiation-saving CTA compared to the standard CTA. CONCLUSIONS:
               The CM dose (-26\%) or radiation dose (-30\%) for
               thoracoabdominal CTA can be reduced while maintaining objective
               and subjective image quality, demonstrating the feasibility of

               patients with lung cancer. FDG-PET/CT imaging is now part of the
               routine staging. Despite thorough preoperative staging nodal
               upstaging still occurs in early-stage lung cancer. However, the
               predictive value of preoperative PET metrics of the primary
               tumor on nodal upstaging remains to be unexplored. Our aim was
               to assess the association of these preoperative PET-parameters
               with nodal upstaging in histologically confirmed lung
               adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. METHODS: From
               January 2016 to November 2018, 500 patients with pT1-T2/cN0 lung
               cancer received an anatomical resection with curative intent.
               171 patients with adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma and
               available PET-CTs were retrospectively included. We analyzed the
               the association of nodal upstaging with preoperative PET-SUVmax
               and metabolic PET metrics including total lesion glycolysis
               (TLG) and metabolic tumor volume (MTV) with different defined
               thresholds. RESULTS: High values of preoperative PET-SUVmax of
               the primary tumor were associated with squamous cell carcinoma
               (p < 0.0001) and with larger tumors (p < 0.0001). Increased
               preoperative C-reactive protein levels (<1mg/dL) correlated
               significantly with high preoperative PET-SUVmax values (p <
               0.0001). No significant relationship between PET-SUVmax and
               lactate dehydrogenase activity (p = 0.6818), white blood cell
               count (p = 0.7681), gender (p = 0.1115) or age (p = 0.9284) was
               observed. Nodal upstaging rate was 14.0 \% with 8.8 \% N1 and
               5.3 \% N2 upstaging. Tumor size (p = 0.0468) and number of
               removed lymph nodes (p = 0.0461) were significant predictors of
               nodal upstaging but no significant association was found with
               histology or PET parameters. Of note, increased MTV - regardless
               of the threshold - tended to associate with nodal upstaging.

               cancer and synchronous liver metastases. Pretrained deep
               learning models were used to assess body composition and liver
               metastasis geometry from abdominal CT images before the
               initiation of systemic treatment. Abdominal muscle-to-bone ratio
               (MBR) was calculated by dividing abdominal muscle volume by
               abdominal bone volume. MBR was compared with body mass index
               (BMI), abdominal muscle volume, and abdominal muscle volume
               divided by height squared. Differences in overall survival based
               on body composition and liver metastasis parameters were
               compared using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Results were
               correlated with clinical and biomarker data to develop a machine
               learning model for survival risk prognostication. RESULTS: The
               MBR, unlike abdominal muscle volume or BMI, was significantly
               associated with overall survival (HR 0.39, 95\% CI: 0.19-0.80, P
               = 0.009). The MBR (P = 0.022), liver metastasis surface area (P
               = 0.01) and primary tumour sidedness (P = 0.007) were
               independently associated with overall survival in multivariate
               analysis. Body composition parameters did not correlate with
               KRAS mutational status or primary tumour sidedness. A prediction
               model based on MBR, liver metastasis surface area and primary
               tumour sidedness achieved a concordance index of 0.69.
               CONCLUSIONS: Automated segmentation enables to extract
               prognostic parameters from routine imaging data for personalized
               survival modelling in advanced colorectal cancer patients.",

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVES: Over the course of their treatment, patients often
               switch hospitals, requiring staff at the new hospital to import
               external imaging studies to their local database. In this study,
               the authors present MOdality Mapping and Orchestration (MOMO), a
               Deep Learning-based approach to automate this mapping process by
               combining metadata analysis and a neural network ensemble.
               METHODS: A set of 11,934 imaging series with existing anatomical
               labels was retrieved from the PACS database of the local
               hospital to train an ensemble of neural networks (DenseNet-161
               and ResNet-152), which process radiological images and predict
               the type of study they belong to. We developed an algorithm that
               automatically extracts relevant metadata from imaging studies,
               regardless of their structure, and combines it with the neural
               network ensemble, forming a powerful classifier. A set of 843
               anonymized external studies from 321 hospitals was hand-labeled
               to assess performance. We tested several variations of this
               algorithm. RESULTS: MOMO achieves 92.71\% accuracy and 2.63\%
               minor errors (at 99.29\% predictive power) on the external study
               classification task, outperforming both a commercial product
               (82.86\% accuracy, 1.36\% minor errors, 96.20\% predictive
               power) and a pure neural network ensemble (72.69\% accuracy,
               10.3\% minor errors, 99.05\% predictive power) performing the
               same task. We find that the highest performance is achieved by
               an algorithm that combines all information into one vote-based
               classifier. CONCLUSION: Deep Learning combined with metadata
               matching is a promising and flexible approach for the automated
               classification of external DICOM studies for PACS archiving. KEY
               POINTS: • The algorithm can successfully identify 76 medical
               study types across seven modalities (CT, X-ray angiography,
               radiographs, MRI, PET (+CT/MRI), ultrasound, and mammograms). •
               The algorithm outperforms a commercial product performing the
               same task by a significant margin (> 9\% accuracy gain). • The
               performance of the algorithm increases through the application
               of Deep Learning techniques.",

               detector technologies and artificial intelligence based image
               post-reconstruction methods allow to reduce the PET acquisition
               time while maintaining diagnostic quality. The aim of this study
               was to acquire ultra-low-count fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)
               ExtremePET images on a digital PET/computed tomography (CT)
               scanner at an acquisition time comparable to a CT scan and to
               generate synthetic full-dose PET images using an artificial
               neural network. METHODS: This is a prospective, single-arm,
               single-center phase I/II imaging study. A total of 587 patients
               were included. For each patient, a standard and an
               ultra-low-count FDG PET/CT scan (whole-body acquisition time
               about 30 s) were acquired. A modified pix2pixHD deep-learning
               network was trained employing 387 data sets as training and 200
               as test cohort. Three models (PET-only and PET/CT with or
               without group convolution) were compared. Detectability and
               quantification were evaluated. RESULTS: The PET/CT input model
               with group convolution performed best regarding lesion signal
               recovery and was selected for detailed evaluation. Synthetic PET
               images were of high visual image quality; mean absolute lesion
               SUVmax (maximum standardized uptake value) difference was 1.5.
               Patient-based sensitivity and specificity for lesion detection
               were 79\% and 100\%, respectively. Not-detected lesions were of
               lower tracer uptake and lesion volume. In a matched-pair
               comparison, patient-based (lesion-based) detection rate was 89\%
               (78\%) for PERCIST (PET response criteria in solid
               tumors)-measurable and 36\% (22\%) for non PERCIST-measurable
               lesions. CONCLUSION: Lesion detectability and lesion
               quantification were promising in the context of extremely fast
               acquisition times. Possible application scenarios might include
               re-staging of late-stage cancer patients, in whom assessment of
               total tumor burden can be of higher relevance than detailed
               evaluation of small and low-uptake lesions.",

              of tissue types. We investigate the association of two BCA-based
              biomarkers with the development of severe SARS-CoV-2 infections
              for 918 patients (354 female, 564 male) regarding disease
              severity and mortality (186 deceased). Multiple tissues, such as
              muscle, bone, or adipose tissue are used and acquired with a
              deep-learning-based, fully-automated BCA from computed tomography
              images of the chest. The BCA features and markers were
              univariately analyzed with a Shapiro-Wilk and two-sided
              Mann-Whitney-U test. In a multivariate approach, obtained markers
              were adjusted by a defined set of laboratory parameters promoted

              markers and two endpoints, namely severity and mortality, was
              investigated with regard to statistical significance. The
              univariate approach showed that the muscle volume was significant
              for female (pseverity $\leq$ 0.001, pmortality $\leq$ 0.0001) and
              male patients (pseverity = 0.018, pmortality $\leq$ 0.0001)
              regarding the severity and mortality endpoints. For male
              patients, the intra- and intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) (p

              and pericardial adipose tissue (PAT) (p $\leq$ 0.0001) were
              significant regarding the severity outcome. With the mortality
              outcome, muscle (p $\leq$ 0.0001), IMAT (p $\leq$ 0.001), EAT (p
              = 0.011) and PAT (p = 0.003) remained significant. For female
              patients, bone (p $\leq$ 0.001), IMAT (p = 0.032) and PAT (p =
              0.047) were significant in univariate analyses regarding the
              severity and bone (p = 0.005) regarding the mortality.
              Furthermore, the defined sarcopenia marker (p $\leq$ 0.0001, for
              female and male) was significant for both endpoints. The cardiac
              marker was significant for severity (pfemale = 0.014, pmale
              $\leq$ 0.0001) and for mortality (pfemale $\leq$ 0.0001, pmale
              $\leq$ 0.0001) endpoint for both genders. The multivariate
              logistic regression showed that the sarcopenia marker was
              significant (pseverity = 0.006, pmortality = 0.002) for both
              endpoints (ORseverity = 0.42, 95\% CIseverity: 0.23-0.78,

              endpoint (OR = 1.42, 95\% CI 1.06-1.90). The association between
              BCA-based sarcopenia and cardiac biomarkers and disease severity
              and mortality suggests that these biomarkers can contribute to
              the risk stratification of SARS-CoV-2 patients. Patients with a
              higher cardiac marker and a lower sarcopenia marker are at risk
              for a severe course or death. Whether those biomarkers hold
