   abstract = {In vivo plasmid end-joining assays are valuable tools for dissecting important qualitative and quantitative aspects of non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ)--a key mechanism for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in higher eukaryotes. They enable the use of defined DNA ends as substrates for end-joining and the analysis by sequencing of the resulting junctions to identify the repair pathways engaged. Yet, plasmid assays have generated divergent results of end-joining capacity in the same DSB repair mutants when used under different conditions, which implies contributions from undefined and therefore uncontrolled parameters. To help standardize these assays, we searched for parameters underpinning these variations and identified transfection method as an important determinant. Here, we compare a lipid-based transfection method, lipofection, with an electroporation method, nucleofection, and find large, unanticipated and cell line-dependent differences in percent end-joining without recognizable trends. For example, in rodent cells, transfection using lipofection gives nearly WT end-joining in DNA-PKcs mutants and only mildly inhibited end-joining in Lig4 and Ku mutants. In contrast, transfection using nucleofection shows marked end-joining inhibition in all NHEJ mutants tested as compared to the WT. In human HCT116 cells, end-joining after nucleofection is strongly suppressed even in the WT and the differences to the mutants are small. After lipofection, in contrast, end-joining is high in WT cells and markedly suppressed in the mutants. We conclude that better understanding and control of the physicochemical/biological and analytical parameters underpinning these differences will be required to generate with plasmid assays results with quantitative power comparable to that of well-established methods of DSB analysis such as pulsed-field gel electrophoresis or gamma-H2AX foci scoring. Until then, caution is needed in the interpretation of the results obtained - particularly with reference to pathway efficiency and residual damage - and confirmation of critical results with alternative transfection approaches is advisable.},

   abstract = {Radiation therapy plays an important role in the management of a wide range of cancers. Besides innovations in the physical application of radiation dose, radiation therapy is likely to benefit from novel approaches exploiting differences in radiation response between normal and tumor cells. While ionizing radiation induces a variety of DNA lesions, including base damages and single-strand breaks, the DNA double-strand break (DSB) is widely considered as the lesion responsible not only for the aimed cell killing of tumor cells, but also for the general genomic instability that leads to the development of secondary cancers among normal cells. Homologous recombination repair (HRR), non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), and alternative NHEJ, operating as a backup, are the major pathways utilized by cells for the processing of DSBs. Therefore, their function represents a major mechanism of radiation resistance in tumor cells. HRR is also required to overcome replication stress - a potent contributor to genomic instability that fuels cancer development. HRR and alternative NHEJ show strong cell-cycle dependency and are likely to benefit from radiation therapy mediated redistribution of tumor cells throughout the cell-cycle. Moreover, the synthetic lethality phenotype documented between HRR deficiency and PARP inhibition has opened new avenues for targeted therapies. These observations make HRR a particularly intriguing target for treatments aiming to improve the efficacy of radiation therapy. Here, we briefly describe the major pathways of DSB repair and review their possible contribution to cancer cell radioresistance. Finally, we discuss promising alternatives for targeting DSB repair to improve radiation therapy and cancer treatment.},

   abstract = {In budding yeast, one-ended DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and damaged replication forks are repaired by break-induced replication (BIR), a homologous recombination pathway that requires the Pol32 subunit of DNA polymerase delta. DNA replication stress is prevalent in cancer, but BIR has not been characterized in mammals. In a cyclin E overexpression model of DNA replication stress, POLD3, the human ortholog of POL32, was required for cell cycle progression and processive DNA synthesis. Segmental genomic duplications induced by cyclin E overexpression were also dependent on POLD3, as were BIR-mediated recombination events captured with a specialized DSB repair assay. We propose that BIR repairs damaged replication forks in mammals, accounting for the high frequency of genomic duplications in human cancers.},

   abstract = {In concurrent chemoradiotherapy, drugs are used to sensitize tumors to ionizing radiation. Although a spectrum of indications for simultaneous treatment with drugs and radiation has been defined, the molecular mechanisms underpinning tumor radiosensitization remain incompletely characterized for several such combinations. Here, we investigate the mechanisms of radiosensitization by the arabinoside nucleoside analogue 9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyladenine (araA) placing particular emphasis on the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB), and compare the results to those obtained with fludarabine (F-araA) and cytarabine (araC). Postirradiation treatment with araA strongly sensitizes cells to ionizing radiation, but leaves unchanged DSB repair by NHEJ in logarithmically growing cells, in sorted G1 or G2 phase populations, as well as in cells in the plateau phase of growth. Notably, araA strongly inhibits DSB repair by homologous recombination (HRR), as assessed by scoring ionizing radiation-induced RAD51 foci, and in functional assays using integrated reporter constructs. Cells compromised in HRR by RNAi-mediated transient knockdown of RAD51 show markedly reduced radiosensitization after treatment with araA. Remarkably, mutagenic DSB repair compensates for HRR inhibition in araA-treated cells. Compared with araA, F-araA and araC are only modestly radiosensitizing under the conditions examined. We propose that the radiosensitizing potential of nucleoside analogues is linked to their ability to inhibit HRR and concomitantly promote the error-prone processing of DSBs. Our observations pave the way to treatment strategies harnessing the selective inhibitory potential of nucleoside analogues and the development of novel compounds specifically utilizing HRR inhibition as a means of tumor cell radiosensitization.},

   abstract = {Eukaryotic cells respond to DNA damage by activating a comprehensive network of biochemical pathways that enable damage recognition and initiate responses leading to repair, apoptosis/autophagy or senescence. This network of responses is commonly described as the "DNA damage response" (DDR). Among the plethora of lesions generated in the DNA from various physical and chemical agents in the environment and in the cell, DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) and DNA replication stress (RS) are the most severe and induce strong DDR, as they bear high risk for cell death, or genomic alterations ultimately causing cancer. Here, we focus on DSBs and provide a state-of-the-art review of the molecular underpinnings of repair pathways that process DSBs in higher eukaryotes, their strengths and limitations, as well as aspects of repair pathway choice and hierarchy. Furthermore, we discuss the regulation of DSB repair pathways throughout the cell cycle and by processes affecting the proliferative state of the cell. We review the role of growth factors and their receptors in the regulation of each DSB repair pathway and discuss aspects of systemic regulation of DNA repair.},

   abstract = {The classical G2-assay is widely used to assess cell-radiosensitivity and cancer phenotype: Cells are exposed to low doses of ionizing-radiation (IR) and collected for cytogenetic- analysis 1.5 h later. In this way, chromosome-damage is measured in cells irradiated in G2-phase, without retrieving information regarding kinetics of chromosome-break-repair. Modification of the assay to include analysis at multiple time-points after IR, has enabled kinetic-analysis of chromatid-break-repair and assessment of damage in a larger proportion of G2-phase cells. This modification, however, increases the probability that at later time points not only cells irradiated in G2-phase, but also cells irradiated in S-phase will reach metaphase. However, the response of cells irradiated in G2-phase can be mechanistically different from that of cells irradiated in S-phase. Therefore, indiscriminate analysis may confound the interpretation of experiments designed to elucidate mechanisms of chromosome-break-repair and the contributions of the different DSB-repair-pathways in this response. Here we report an EdU based modification of the assay that enables S- and G2-phase specific analysis of chromatid break repair. Our results show that the majority of metaphases captured during the first 2 h after IR originate from cells irradiated in G2-phase (EdU(-) metaphases) in both rodent and human cells. Metaphases originating from cells irradiated in S-phase (EdU(+) metaphases) start appearing at 2 h and 4 h after IR in rodent and human cells, respectively. The kinetics of chromatid-break-repair are similar in cells irradiated in G2- and S-phase of the cell-cycle, both in rodent and human cells. The protocol is applicable to classical-cytogenetic experiments and allows the cell-cycle specific analysis of chromosomal-aberrations. Finally, the protocol can be applied to the kinetic analysis of chromosome-breaks in prematurely-condensed-chromosomes of G2-phase cells. In summary, the developed protocol provides means to enhance the analysis of IR-induced-cytogenetic-damage by providing information on the cell-cycle phase where DNA damage is inflicted.},

   abstract = {Alternative end-joining (alt-EJ) is a DNA end resection-dependent, error-prone pathway utilized by vertebrate cells to repair DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), but its engagement is linked to chromosomal translocations and genomic instability. Here, we report that when proliferating cells are exposed to ionizing radiation, treatment with nucleoside analogs (NAs) causes strong radiosensitization by increasing engagement of alt-EJ, while at the same time suppressing homologous recombination (HR) in S- and G2phase cells. This NA-mediated pathway shift may reflect a passive compensatory engagement of alt-EJ following HR suppression that is specific for S- and G2-phase cells, and/or the direct activation of alt-EJ throughout the cell cycle. To distinguish between these possibilities, we utilize here a cell culture model that exploits genetic and cell cycle-dependent inactivation of DSB repair pathways, to exclusively study alt-EJ and its modulation by NAs in murine and human cell lines. To this end, we allow LIG4-/--deficient cells to accumulate in G1/G0 phase by transfer to serum-deprived media and obtain cells deficient in c-NHEJ owing to the genetic LIG4 knockout, deficient in HR owing to the absence of S- or G2-phase cells, and compromised in their ability to carry out alt-EJ owing to their accumulation in G0. We find that in these cells irradiation and treatment with the NA, beta-arabinofuranosyladenine (araA), and to a lesser degree with other NAs, promptly activates suppressed alt-EJ that now functions at levels approximating those of c-NHEJ in wild-type cells. Results at high dose (20 Gy) generated using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) are corroborated by results at low dose (1 Gy) generated by scoring 53BP1 foci. Strikingly, araA treatment activates a normally undetectable DNA-end-resection at DSBs, which requires ATR activity, but proceeds unimpeded after CtIP knockdown. Treatment with araA increases the formation of chromosomal aberrations and enhances radiation-induced cell killing. The results support direct stimulation of resection by NAs and alt-EJ as a mechanism of their documented radiosensitizing potential. We propose that this stimulation also occurs in repair-proficient cells and that it occurs throughout the cell cycle. It may therefore be harnessed to develop protocols combining NAs with radiation to treat human cancer.},

We here describe a computational workflow for identification of DNA circles from long-read sequencing data. The workflow is implemented based on the Snakemake workflow management system. Its key step uses a graph-theoretic approach to identify putative circular fragments validated on simulated reads. We then demonstrate robustness of our approach using nanopore sequencing of selectively enriched circular DNA by highly sensitive and specific recovery of plasmids and the mitochondrial genome, which is the only circular DNA in normal human cells. Finally, we show that the workflow facilitates detection of larger circular DNA fragments containing extrachromosomal copies of the MYCN oncogene and the respective breakpoints, which is a potentially useful application in disease monitoring of several cancer types.},

In this study, we empirically evaluate a more powerful ensemble learning algorithm, multi-view stacked generalization, on pediatric inflammatory bowel disease and adult colorectal cancer patients' cohorts. We aim to check whether stacking would lead to better results compared to using a single best machine learning algorithm. Stacking achieves the best test set Average Precision (AP) on inflammatory bowel disease dataset reaching AP = 0.69, outperforming both the best base classifier (AP = 0.61) and the baseline meta learner built on top of base classifiers (AP = 0.63). On colorectal cancer dataset, the stacked classifier also outperforms (AP = 0.81) both the best base classifier (AP = 0.79) and the baseline meta learner (AP = 0.75). Stacking achieves best predictive performance on test set outperforming the best classifiers on both patient cohorts. Application of the stacking solves the issue of choosing the most appropriate machine learning algorithm by automating the model selection procedure. Clinical application of such a model is not limited to diagnosis task only, but it also can be extended to biomarker selection thanks to feature selection procedure.},

abstract = {Wastewater surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 proved useful, including for identifying the local appearance of newly identified virus variants. Previous studies focused on wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) with sewersheds of several hundred thousand people or at single building level, representing only a small number of people. Both approaches may prove inadequate for small-scale intra-urban inferences for early detection of emerging or novel virus variants. Our study aims (i) to analyze SARS-CoV-2 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in wastewater of sub-sewersheds and WWTP using whole genome sequencing in order to (ii) investigate the potential of small-scale detection of novel known SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) within a metropolitan wastewater system. We selected three sub-sewershed sampling sites, based on estimated population- and built environment-related indicators, and the inlet of the receiving WWTP in the Ruhr region, Germany. Untreated wastewater was sampled weekly between October and December 2021, with a total of 22 samples collected. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was analyzed by RT-qPCR and whole genome sequencing. For all samples, genome sequences were obtained, while only 13 samples were positive for RT-qPCR. We identified multiple specific SARS-CoV-2 SNVs in the wastewater samples of the sub-sewersheds and the WWTP. Identified SNVs reflected the dominance of VOC Delta at the time of sampling. Interestingly, we could identify an Omicron-specific SNV in one sub-sewershed. A concurrent wastewater study sampling the same WWTP detected the VOC Omicron one week later. Our observations suggest that the small-scale approach may prove particularly useful for the detection and description of spatially confined emerging or existing virus variants circulating in populations. Future studies applying small-scale sampling strategies taking into account the specific features of the wastewater system will be useful to analyze temporal and spatial variance in more detail.}

ABSTRACT={<sec>BackgroundBreakthrough infections with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants are increasingly observed in vaccinated individuals. Immune responses towards SARS-CoV-2 variants, particularly Omicron-BA.5, are poorly understood. We investigated the humoral and cellular immune responses of hospitalized COVID-19 patients during Delta and Omicron infection waves.</sec><sec>MethodsThe corresponding SARS-CoV-2 variant of the respective patients were identified by whole genome sequencing. Humoral immune responses were analyzed by ELISA and a cell culture-based neutralization assay against SARS-CoV-2 D614G isolate (wildtype), Alpha, Delta (AY.43) and Omicron (BA.1 and BA.5). Cellular immunity was evaluated with an IFN-γ ELISpot assay.</sec><sec>ResultsOn a cellular level, patients showed a minor IFN-γ response after stimulating PBMCs with mutated regions of SARS-CoV-2 variants. Neutralizing antibody titers against Omicron-BA.1 and especially BA.5 were strongly reduced. Double-vaccinated patients with Delta breakthrough infection showed a significantly increased neutralizing antibody response against Delta compared to double-vaccinated uninfected controls (median complete neutralization titer (NT<sub>100</sub>) 640 versus 80, p<0.05). Omicron-BA.1 infection increased neutralization titers against BA.1 in double-vaccinated patients (median NT<sub>100</sub> of 160 in patients versus 20 in controls, p=0.07) and patients that received booster vaccination (median NT<sub>100</sub> of 50 in patients versus 20 in controls, p=0.68). For boosted patients with BA.5 breakthrough infection, we found no enhancing effect on humoral immunity against SARS-CoV-2 variants.</sec><sec>ConclusionNeutralizing antibody titers against Omicron-BA.1 and especially BA.5 were strongly reduced in SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections. Delta and Omicron-BA.1 but not Omicron-BA.5 infections boosted the humoral immunity in double-vaccinated patients and patients with booster vaccination. Despite BA.5 breakthrough infection, those patients may still be vulnerable for reinfections with BA.5 or other newly emerging variants of concern.</sec>}

ABSTRACT={<p>Climate change can alter the flow of nutrients and energy through terrestrial ecosystems. Using an inverse climate change field experiment in the central European Alps, we explored how long-term irrigation of a naturally drought-stressed pine forest altered the metabolic potential of the soil microbiome and its ability to decompose lignocellulolytic compounds as a critical ecosystem function. Drought mitigation by a decade of irrigation stimulated profound changes in the functional capacity encoded in the soil microbiome, revealing alterations in carbon and nitrogen metabolism as well as regulatory processes protecting microorganisms from starvation and desiccation. Despite the structural and functional shifts from oligotrophic to copiotrophic microbial lifestyles under irrigation and the observation that different microbial taxa were involved in the degradation of cellulose and lignin as determined by a time-series stable-isotope probing incubation experiment with <sup>13</sup>C-labeled substrates, degradation rates of these compounds were not affected by different water availabilities. These findings provide new insights into the impact of precipitation changes on the soil microbiome and associated ecosystem functioning in a drought-prone pine forest and will help to improve our understanding of alterations in biogeochemical cycling under a changing climate.</p>}}

abstract = {Abstract Microbial communities in freshwater streams play an essential role in ecosystem functioning via biogeochemical cycling. Yet, the impacts of treated wastewater influx into stream ecosystems on microbial strain diversity remain mostly unexplored. Here, we coupled full-length 16S ribosomal RNA¬†gene Nanopore sequencing and strain-resolved metagenomics to investigate the impact of treated wastewater on a mesocosm system (AquaFlow) run with restored river water. Over 10 days, community Bray‚ÄìCurtis dissimilarities between treated and control mesocosm decreased (0.57‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ0.058 to 0.26‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ0.046) based on ribosomal protein S3 gene clustering, finally converging to nearly identical communities. Similarly, strain-resolved metagenomics revealed a high diversity of bacteria and viruses after the introduction of treated wastewater; these microbes also decreased over time resulting in the same strain clusters in control and treatment at the end of the experiment. Specifically, 39.2\% of viral strains detected in all samples were present after the introduction of treated wastewater only. Although bacteria present at low abundance in the treated wastewater introduced additional antibiotic resistance genes, signals of naturally occurring ARG-encoding organisms resembled the resistome at the endpoint. Our results suggest that the previously stressed freshwater stream and its microbial community are resilient to a substantial introduction of treated wastewater.},

abstract = {Wastewater analysis can serve as a source of public health information. In recent years, wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has emerged and proven useful for the detection of infectious diseases. However, insights from the wastewater treatment plant do not allow for the small-scale differentiation within the sewer system that is needed to analyze the target population under study in more detail. Small-scale WBE offers several advantages, but there has been no systematic overview of its application. The aim of this scoping review is to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge on small-scale WBE for infectious diseases, including methodological considerations for its application. A systematic database search was conducted, considering only peer-reviewed articles. Data analyses included quantitative summary and qualitative narrative synthesis. Of 2130 articles, we included 278, most of which were published since 2020. The studies analyzed wastewater at the building level (n = 203), especially healthcare (n = 110) and educational facilities (n = 80), and at the neighborhood scale (n = 86). The main analytical parameters were viruses (n = 178), notably SARS-CoV-2 (n = 161), and antibiotic resistance (ABR) biomarkers (n = 99), often analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), with DNA sequencing techniques being less common. In terms of sampling techniques, active sampling dominated. The frequent lack of detailed information on the specification of selection criteria and the characterization of the small-scale sampling sites was identified as a concern. In conclusion, based on the large number of studies, we identified several methodological considerations and overarching strategic aspects for small-scale WBE. An enabling environment for small-scale WBE requires inter- and transdisciplinary knowledge sharing across countries. Promoting the adoption of small-scale WBE will benefit from a common international conceptualization of the approach, including standardized and internationally accepted terminology. In particular, the development of good WBE practices for different aspects of small-scale WBE is warranted. This includes the establishment of guidelines for a comprehensive characterization of the local sewer system and its sub-sewersheds, and transparent reporting to ensure comparability of small-scale WBE results.}

ABSTRACT = {While SARS-CoV-2 has transitioned to an endemic phase, infections caused by newly emerged variants continue to result in severe, and sometimes fatal, outcomes or lead to long-term COVID-19 symptoms. Vulnerable populations, such as PLWH, face an elevated risk of severe illness. Emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2, including numerous Omicron subvariants, are increasingly associated with breakthrough infections. Adapting mRNA vaccines to these new variants may offer improved protection against Omicron for vulnerable individuals. In this study, we examined humoral and cellular immune responses before and after administering adapted booster vaccinations to PLWH, alongside a control group of healthy individuals. Four weeks following booster vaccination, both groups exhibited a significant increase in neutralizing antibodies and cellular immune responses. Notably, there was no significant difference in humoral immune response between PLWH and the healthy controls. Immune responses declined rapidly in both groups three months post vaccination. However, PLWH still showed significantly increased neutralizing antibody titers even after three months. These findings demonstrate the efficacy of the adapted vaccination regimen. The results suggest that regular booster immunizations may be necessary to sustain protective immunity.},
